<h3 style="color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.682);">DRUGS</h3>
<p style="color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.682);">Drugs. Why? Well, I figured that if I can get all the bad things out the way right now, the rest of this should seem more positive. This is honestly one of the topics I could rant and rant about. It's incredibly deep with so many different categories. To start it off, here is a list of every drug I've tried.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Alcohol</li>
    <li>Nicotine</li>
    <li>Marijuana/Weed</li>
    <li>Mushrooms</li>
    <li>Acid/LSD</li>
    <li>Klonopin</li>
    <li>Dimethyltryptamine/DMT</li>
    <li>MDMA/Molly</li>
    <li>Cocaine/Coke</li>
    <li>Esketamine</li>
    <li>Nitrous/Whippets</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.682);">Starting with Alcohol. It's caused a few problems in my life but not enough to make me wish I didn't start. I started drinking when I was either mid 16 or early 17. I would drink with friends, usually in public spaces. The best part about it is that whe you drink, it's always like the first time(at least for me). I would come into my first job sometimes a little tipsy or drunk even, not understanding the severity of my actions. When my parents found out about my drinking they had me change High Schools to hopefully find a better crowd of friends. Alcohol is a good one.</p>
<p style="color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.682);">Nicotine has been an absolute bitch since I was 16. I started off vaping which I do not do anymore. I'd get my plug to buy me a vape and I'd throw him a $5 as a tip lol. I've trie quitting numerous times but it seems to have a choke hold on my mental. I've vaped, smoked cigarettes and used zyn. There was a time where I would swap between them thinking that one is going to be better and help me get off of it. I think I'll probably use this for the rest of my life like alcohol.</p>
<p style="color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.682);">Weed. I started smoking weed when I began my career at Gusano's. I had taken a small edible before then which was an absolutly wild experience. I was in a public swimming pool having a great time with a friend of the past named Ben when all of a sudden everything was in slow motion, or I was just hyper aware of my surroundings who knows. I started geeking and made him hang out in the shower room with me for 2 hours until it had kind of gone down. I smoked heavily after starting at Gusano's where I smoked Bud for the first time. Bud is a beautiful thing but I don't use this anymore due to the anxiety it causes. I was all about weed though. My FTM boyfriend had a medical card when I worked at Gusano's and he would buy weed/carts for us to smoke all the time. I wish I could use it again, maybe I'll try once more in the future.</p>
<p style="color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.682);">I used to grow mushrooms actually. Back when I was freshly 18, I got my hands on some shrooms from an oven guy at the Gusano's bentonville location named Butch. Butch was this really big red head with a massive neck beard with a horrible drinking problem. He sold me some Penis Envy (PE) and the first time I took them, I didn't know how much I was actually eating so I probably ate around 2-3 grams. Penis envy are actually really potent Psilocybin fungus. While I was tripping for my first time at a bar, I started to see things change slightly but I couldn't put my finger on it. Eventually everything was incredibly exaggerated and flowy. One of my main stories that I like to tell people about mushrooms is back when I lived with Riley and I was growing a metric fuck-ton. I would trip any free day off I had from work. One day, I took 5 Grams of B+ and while laying in my bed staring at the ceiling, saw a biblically accurate angle living on the 2D space which was my ceiling. Another one was when I took 7 grams of Golden Teachers which I really don't remember that well other than feeling disgusting for what I had done and wanting to talk to my parents out of shame. I wanted to take a shower and wash the feeling off but it wouldn't work. I felt like a dissapointment because I was doing lots of mushrooms and my poor LDS mother would loose it if she had found out. One time, I was tripping with Aubrey and her friend who I cannot seem to remember the name of. They were having an incredible bonding experience while I was in absolute panic mode thinking the cops were going to show up. The part that freaked me out the most was that her friend was 17 almost 18 and I think I was freshly 19 or almost there. I never did anything wrong I was just tripping balls freaking out laying on the carpet floor. Back to the growing though, the ones that I've grown are (listed in least to most potent) B+, Golden Teachers, Albino Penis Envy. I have a tattoo of Golden Teacher Mushrooms on my right shoulder. At first it didn't have much meaning but a week later I had an intense time with a dose and it quickly gave my tattoo meaning. Mushrooms helped me come back to God as crazy as that seems. I partially believe that mushrooms are a way to see God if you will. All of the swaying patterns and energy you see feel and hear on mushrooms is God and you see God in everything when you trip Mushrooms. Mushrooms come from the Earth, they're a gift to be used in moderation.</p>
