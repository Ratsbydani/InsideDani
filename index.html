<p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">This is a website that contains everything inside my head. I figured it would be easier for others to understand myself if it was all written out. This all begins on January 25th 2025.</p>
<h3 style="color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.682);">DRUGS</h3>
<p style="color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.682);">Drugs. This is honestly one of the topics I could rant and rant about. It's incredibly deep with so many different categories. To start it off, here is a list of every drug I've tried.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Alcohol</li>
    <li>Nicotine</li>
    <li>Marijuana/Weed</li>
    <li>Mushrooms</li>
    <li>Acid/LSD</li>
    <li>Klonopin</li>
    <li>Dimethyltryptamine/DMT</li>
    <li>MDMA/Molly</li>
    <li>Cocaine/Coke</li>
    <li>Esketamine</li>
    <li>Nitrous/Whippets</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting with Alcohol. It's caused a few problems in my life but not enough to make me wish I didn't start. I started drinking when I was either mid 16 or early 17. I would drink with friends, usually in public spaces. The best part about it is that whe you drink, it's always like the first time(at least for me). I would come into my first job sometimes a little tipsy or drunk even, not understanding the severity of my actions. When my parents found out about my drinking they had me change High Schools to hopefully find a better crowd of friends. Alcohol is a good one.</p>
<p>Nicotine has been an absolute bitch since I was 16. I started off vaping which I do not do anymore. I'd get my plug to buy me a vape and I'd throw him a $5 as a tip lol. I've trie quitting numerous times but it seems to have a choke hold on my mental. I've vaped, smoked cigarettes and used zyn. There was a time where I would swap between them thinking that one is going to be better and help me get off of it. I think I'll probably use this for the rest of my life like alcohol.</p>
