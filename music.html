        <p><strong>Sp33din'/Swallowed My Key - Slater</strong></p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PPWRREK2Mzg" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Two songs in one video. Both of which are great to just cruise around listening to. For me, it really sets the vibes right for a night cruise. It's something about the energy that these two songs give off, very indie and have a solid beat. Slater was my top artist of 2024 on Spotify and to me it's very clear as to why.</p>

    <div class="music-card">
        <p><strong>Aqueous Transmission - Incubus</strong></p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BQZ624p4uGU" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This song is incredibly unique. The way the song seems to flow like water the entire time is beautiful. Incubus was my top artist for 2023 on Spotify.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="music-card">
        <p><strong>What Once Was - Her's</strong></p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-B-BBwfAWU" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Yet another unique indie song, and my favorite as well. This song is actually super deep. The song is named "What Once Was" which perfectly mirrors the lyrics. My favorite lyrics read, "Baby, I've been there before, I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone, And now I'm still hanging on, I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was." I think a lot of us can actually relate to this snippet. Holding onto the fraying tether of something or someone wishing you could have what once was.</p>

    <div class="music-card">
        <p><strong>Turkey - Clock Tower(full album)</strong></p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D4nCrSQVCVA" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>I found this on my for you page on 1/28/2025 and I really like the vibe. Just a little something I added to show off more of my taste.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="music-card">
        <p><strong>Cemetery Gates - Pantera</strong></p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVMvART9kb8" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This was the first song that I ever deemed my "Favorite". I remember the first time I heard it in my dad's truck back when we lived in South Dakota. The next day at school I asked everyone in my class if they had heard of it, most saying no so when we had computer lab I looked it up to show off to my friends lol. I got to see these guys in concert at the Walmart AMP which was really something. Sadly we had to leave a little early so I said K.</p>

    <div class="music-card">
        <p><strong>Lazy Eye - Silversun Pickups</strong></p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-mxBDuRaZ8" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>I was actually shown this song by a friend. I think he introduced me to it as his mom's favorite song.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="music-card">
        <p><strong>Sex Tape - Deftones</strong></p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f0pdwd0miqs" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>I need to see Deftones Live. I've got him to thank for a lot of my music taste actually. I love the floaty feeling this song gives off, the way it never gets too aggressive and stays floaty makes me very happy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="music-card">
        <p><strong>Locket - Crumb</strong></p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqnG_Ei35JE" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Crumb has this way of making the most ethereal songs. I cannot even begin to describe their music, it's just so damn unique.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="music-card">
        <p><strong>Ghostride - Crumb</strong></p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HS4aJ_51qNQ" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Another Crumb song yes. This was the first one I've ever heard by them.</p>
