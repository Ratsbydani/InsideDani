<p>Two songs in one video. Both of which are great to just cruise around listening to. For me, it really sets the vibes right for a night cruise. It's something about the energy that these two songs give off, very indie and have a solid beat. Slater was my top artist of 2024 on Spotify and to me it's very clear as to why.</p>

<p>This song is incredibly unique. The way the song seems to flow like water the entire time is beautiful. Incubus was my top artist for 2023 on Spotify.</p>

<p style="color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.526);">What Once Was - Her's</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-B-BBwfAWU"></iframe>
<p>Yet another unique indie song, and my favorite as well. This song is actually super deep. The song is named "What Once Was" which perfectly mirrors the lyrics. My favoite lyrics read, "Baby, I've been there before, I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone, And now I'm still hanging on, I was at the end of every tether waiting for what once was." I think a lot of us can actually relate to this snippet. Holding onto the fraying tether of something or someone wishing you could have what once was.</p>
